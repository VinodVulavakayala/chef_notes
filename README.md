Check inspec from github code
inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline 

run specific control:
inspec exec  https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline --controls package-08

You detected issues both by running InSpec locally and by running InSpec remotely on a target system.
You downloaded a basic InSpec profile and used a community profile from Chef Supermarket.
You limited your InSpec runs to certain controls and formatted the output as JSON so you can generate reports.
You packaged your profile to make it easier to distribute.

inspec.yml -->includes the profile description (required)
controls --->is the directory in which all tests are located (required)
libraries---> is the directory in which all Chef InSpec resource extensions are located (optional)
files---> is the directory with additional files that a profile can access (optional)
README.md--->should be used to explain the profile, its scope, and usage

When the lock file is created it will cache the all dependencies and generate .lock file

control (line 12) is followed by the control's name. Each control in a profile has a unique name.
impact (line 13) measures the relative importance of the test and must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
title (line 14) defines the control's purpose.
desc (line 15) provides a more complete description of what the control checks for.
describe (lines 16 â€” 18) defines the test. Here, the test checks for the existence of the /tmp directory.


In Ruby, the do and end keywords define a block. An InSpec control always contains at least one describe block. However, a control can contain many describe blocks.

Understand a describe block's structure
As with many test frameworks, InSpec code resembles natural language. Here's the format of a describe block.

describe <entity> do
  it { <expectation> }
end
Entity:  example, a package name, service, file, or network port.
  
The <expectation> part specifies the desired result or expected state.
 example, that a port should be open
